Task Buddy

Task Buddy was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the current version it runs locally. Data is saved in local storage.

The home page of Task Buddy gives you a complete view of all of your tasks. Tasks can be edited and deleted right from the homepage. New tasks can be added by clicking the Add Task button at the top of the page.
